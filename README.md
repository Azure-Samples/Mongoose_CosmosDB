# Developing a Mongoose Framework app using Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API
This tutorial demonstrates how to use the [Mongoose Framework](http://mongoosejs.com/) when storing data in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB API account. For those of you unfamiliar, Mongoose is an object modeling framework for MongoDB in Node.js and provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data.

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed globally distributed, multi-model database service, transparently replicating your data across any number of Azure regions. You can elastically scale throughput and storage, and take advantage of fast, single-digit-millisecond data access using the API of your choice backed by 99.999 SLA.
